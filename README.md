# SQL-Vancouver
Using Python SQL connector, a high-level look at the disparity in availability of public services in Vancouver city. This project helped me practice my SQL skills as well as the Python SQL connectors.

The reason for using a Python SQL connector to do my SQL project is that it allowed me to display outputs of all of my queries as well as output visualizations all in one place.
