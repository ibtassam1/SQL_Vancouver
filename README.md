# SQL-Vancouver
Using Python SQL connector, a high-level look at the disparity in availability of public services in Vancouver city. This project helped me practice my SQL skills as well as the Python SQL connectors.

The native rendering of GitHub does not output some of the visuals of a Jupyter Notebook. Please follow the NBviewer link to see the fully rendered notebook showing my SQL queries as well as insightful visualizations.
